<h1>Bio</h1>
<p align="justify">
I'm a lecturer and postdoctoral researcher in applied artificial intelligence at the <a href="https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/">Data Science, Data Systems, & Data Services laboratory (DS3)</a> part of the <a href="https://systems.ethz.ch/">Institute for Computing Platforms</a>  at ETH Zurich. 
Previously, I held postdoctoral appointments at the <a href="https://coss.ethz.ch/">Cognitive Science group (COG)</a> and the <a href="https://cog.ethz.ch/">Computational Social Science group (COSS)</a> at ETH Zurich and the <a href="https://www.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ceseri/index_en.html">research centre for Large-​Scale Earthquake, Tsunami and Disaster (LsETD, now CESERI)</a> at the <a href="https://www.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/">Earthquake Research Institute</a> of the University of Tokyo, Japan. 
I obtained my PhD in the <a href="https://www.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/">Computational Science and High-​Performance Computing Laboratory</a> at the University of Tokyo. 
Previously, I held a principal lecturer appointment at the <a href="https://www.uvg.edu.gt/">Universidad del Valle</a>, Guatemala, in both the mathematics and civil engineering departments.
<br>
<br>
My research focuses on modelling, simulating and analysing social phenomena and the development and deployment of AI/ML-based systems to support this. 
I have built systems to analyse AI-driven software agents in artificial worlds in VR (virtual reality) experiments to quantify human behaviour.
<br> 
I have contributed to systems that make ML (machine learning) more accessible for non-experts while ensuring best practices. 
In this context, I have contributed to <a href="https://github.com/easeml/automl">Easeml/AutoML</a>, an automatic ML system that he has helped to integrate into the Swiss Data Science Center’s Renku data science service. 
I have also contributed to <a href="https://github.com/easeml/ci">Easeml/CI</a>, a system for continuously integrating ML models.
